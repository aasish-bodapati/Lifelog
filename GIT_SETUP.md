# Git Repository Setup Guide

## âœ… Local Repository Initialized
Your local Git repository has been successfully initialized with all project files committed.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps: Create Remote Repository

### Option 1: GitHub (Recommended)
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `lifelog` (or your preferred name)
5. Description: "Fitness and nutrition tracking app for busy professionals"
6. Set to **Private** (recommended for personal projects)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Option 2: GitLab
1. Go to [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com) and sign in
2. Click "New project" â†’ "Create blank project"
3. Project name: `lifelog`
4. Set visibility to **Private**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README
6. Click "Create project"

### Option 3: Bitbucket
1. Go to [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org) and sign in
2. Click "Create repository"
3. Repository name: `lifelog`
4. Set to **Private**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

## ðŸ“¤ Push to Remote Repository

After creating the remote repository, run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lifelog.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to remote repository
git push -u origin master
```

## ðŸ”„ Future Workflow

After the initial setup, your daily workflow will be:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .
