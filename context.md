📱 Features Implemented

Backend Features
- User Management: Registration, login, profile updates with secure password hashing
- Fitness Tracking: Log exercises, sets, reps, weight (renamed from Workout)
- Nutrition Logging: Track meals, macros, calories with detailed breakdowns
- Body Stats: Weight, measurements, health metrics tracking
- Analytics: Daily/weekly summaries and progress tracking
- RESTful API: Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM and Pydantic validation

Frontend Features
- Authentication: Login/Register screens with improved error handling and toast notifications
- Onboarding: Streamlined 3-step flow (Profile+Goals, Preferences, Summary)
- Navigation: Bottom tab navigation with 5 main screens (Home, Fitness, Nutrition, Body, Profile)
- State Management: React Context for user, log, and onboarding data
- Offline-First: AsyncStorage with API sync for seamless offline experience
- TypeScript: Full type safety throughout the application
- Modern UI: Clean, professional design optimized for busy professionals
- Toast Notifications: User-friendly feedback system using react-native-simple-toast
- Real-time Calculations: BMR, TDEE, macro targets, and hydration goals
- Form Validation: Real-time validation with clear error messages
🎯 Core Philosophy
- Speed over complexity: 1-tap logging, auto-fill defaults
- Offline-first: Local SQLite with API sync
- Minimal friction: Clean UI, simple navigation
- Professional focus: Built for busy schedules
- Realistic targets: Sustainable protein caps and hydration goals

🎯 Onboarding System (3-Step Flow)
The onboarding has been streamlined from 5 steps to 3 steps for better user experience:

Step 1: Complete Profile & Goals (Combined)
- Basic Information: Age, gender, height, weight with real-time BMI calculation
- Goal Selection: Maintain weight, Gain muscle, Lose fat with visual indicators
- Activity Level: Sedentary to Extra Active with BMR multipliers displayed
- Features: All essential data captured in one comprehensive screen

Step 2: Preferences (Optional)
- Notification toggles: Meal reminders, hydration reminders, weekly progress
- Can be skipped for faster completion
- Stored in user profile for personalization

Step 3: Summary + Confirm
- Personalized targets display with realistic calculations
- Protein caps: 2.0g/kg for muscle gain, 1.6g/kg for others
- Dynamic hydration: Gender-specific (M: 35ml/kg, F: 31ml/kg) + activity bonus
- Final confirmation before entering main app

Calculation Logic:
- BMR: Mifflin-St Jeor equation with gender-specific formulas
- TDEE: BMR × activity multiplier (1.2x to 1.9x)
- Goal adjustments: ±300-500 calories based on goal
- Protein caps: Realistic limits based on body weight
- Hydration: Dynamic based on gender and activity level

📝 Naming Conventions (CRITICAL)
Consistency is essential for long-term maintainability. All naming must follow these standards:

Frontend (React Native/TypeScript):
- Files: PascalCase for components (HomeScreen.tsx), camelCase for utilities (userService.ts)
- Components: PascalCase (const HomeScreen: React.FC = () => {})
- Functions: camelCase (handleLogin, getGreeting)
- Variables: camelCase (userState, logState)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (User, Workout, NutritionLog)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Backend (Python/FastAPI):
- Files: snake_case (fitness.py, body_stats.py, nutrition.py)
- Classes: PascalCase (User, Workout, NutritionLog, BodyStat)
- Functions: snake_case (create_fitness_session, get_body_stats)
- Variables: snake_case (user_id, fitness_id)
- API Endpoints: snake_case (/api/fitness, /api/nutrition, /api/body)

Database:
- Tables: snake_case (workouts, nutrition_logs, body_stats)
- Columns: snake_case (user_id, created_at, body_fat_percentage)

IMPORTANT: When renaming components (like Workout → Fitness), ALL references must be updated:
- Frontend: Component names, service files, navigation, types
- Backend: Route files, function names, API endpoints, imports
- Database: Table names, column references (if applicable)
- Documentation: All references in comments and docs

This prevents confusion and maintains code clarity across the entire project.
