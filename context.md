🎯 Core Philosophy
- Speed over complexity: 1-tap logging, auto-fill defaults
- Offline-first: Local SQLite with API sync
- Minimal friction: Clean UI, simple navigation
- Professional focus: Built for busy schedules
- Realistic targets: Sustainable protein caps and hydration goals

🎯 Onboarding System (3-Step Flow)
The onboarding has been streamlined from 5 steps to 3 steps for better user experience:

Step 1: Complete Profile & Goals (Combined)
- Basic Information: Age, gender, height, weight with real-time BMI calculation
- Goal Selection: Maintain weight, Gain muscle, Lose fat with visual indicators
- Activity Level: Sedentary to Extra Active with BMR multipliers displayed
- Features: All essential data captured in one comprehensive screen

Step 2: Preferences (Optional)
- Notification toggles: Meal reminders, hydration reminders, weekly progress
- Can be skipped for faster completion
- Stored in user profile for personalization

Step 3: Summary + Confirm
- Personalized targets display with realistic calculations
- Protein caps: 2.0g/kg for muscle gain, 1.6g/kg for others
- Dynamic hydration: Gender-specific (M: 35ml/kg, F: 31ml/kg) + activity bonus
- Final confirmation before entering main app

Calculation Logic:
- BMR: Mifflin-St Jeor equation with gender-specific formulas
- TDEE: BMR × activity multiplier (1.2x to 1.9x)
- Goal adjustments: ±300-500 calories based on goal
- Protein caps: Realistic limits based on body weight
- Hydration: Dynamic based on gender and activity level

📝 Naming Conventions (CRITICAL)
Consistency is essential for long-term maintainability. All naming must follow these standards:

Frontend (React Native/TypeScript):
- Files: PascalCase for components (HomeScreen.tsx), camelCase for utilities (userService.ts)
- Components: PascalCase (const HomeScreen: React.FC = () => {})
- Functions: camelCase (handleLogin, getGreeting)
- Variables: camelCase (userState, logState)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (User, Workout, NutritionLog)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Backend (Python/FastAPI):
- Files: snake_case (fitness.py, body_stats.py, nutrition.py)
- Classes: PascalCase (User, Workout, NutritionLog, BodyStat)
- Functions: snake_case (create_fitness_session, get_body_stats)
- Variables: snake_case (user_id, fitness_id)
- API Endpoints: snake_case (/api/fitness, /api/nutrition, /api/body)

Database:
- Tables: snake_case (workouts, nutrition_logs, body_stats)
- Columns: snake_case (user_id, created_at, body_fat_percentage)

IMPORTANT: When renaming components (like Workout → Fitness), ALL references must be updated:
- Frontend: Component names, service files, navigation, types
- Backend: Route files, function names, API endpoints, imports
- Database: Table names, column references (if applicable)
- Documentation: All references in comments and docs

This prevents confusion and maintains code clarity across the entire project.

Ready for: Production deployment, Phase 3 enhancements, or app store submission

🧹 Known Technical Debt (Non-Critical)
1. Duplicate Body Stat Entries (Oct 2025)
   - Issue: Users who logged water before the date comparison fix may have 7-10 duplicate body stat entries for the same date
   - Impact: No functional impact, duplicates are handled correctly by the date normalization fix
   - Solution: Will be cleaned up naturally over time, or can implement one-time cleanup script
   - Priority: Low (cosmetic issue only, does not affect functionality)

🔍 Key Debugging Information
Water Intake Logging:
- Local database stores dates in two formats: "2025-10-17" and "2025-10-17T00:00:00"
- Always normalize dates with .split('T')[0] before comparison
- handleAddWater() updates existing entries instead of creating new ones
- Comprehensive logging added for water intake debugging (can be removed in production)

Sync System:
- syncService.ts cleans data before sending to backend (removes local-only fields)
- Field name mappings: weight_kg → weight, muscle_mass_kg → muscle_mass
- Date normalization: YYYY-MM-DD → YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ for backend compatibility
- user_id passed as query parameter, not in request body for body stats
- Empty body stats (all fields null except water_intake: 0) are skipped during sync
- UPDATE operations without backend_id converted to INSERT to prevent 422 errors
- Duplicate detection: Same local_id only synced once per batch using Set tracking
- DELETE operations for unsynced records are skipped
- Failed sync items marked as synced to prevent blocking future syncs

Performance Optimizations:
- DashboardScreen: useEffect depends only on [userState.user?.id] to prevent duplicate calls
- useFocusEffect: Uses useRef to skip initial mount and avoid overlapping with useEffect
- API logging: Excludes /body and /sync endpoints in production to reduce console noise
