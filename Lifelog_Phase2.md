🗓️ Lifelog Phase 2 Development Plan
🎯 Goal:

Move from working prototype → fully usable MVP that feels frictionless for busy professionals.

1️⃣ Core Data Infrastructure: Offline + Sync System

Objective:
Ensure all logs (workout, nutrition, body stats) work offline and auto-sync later.

Tasks:

 Integrate SQLite for all key entities (workouts, meals, body stats).

 Implement a local SyncQueue table to store unsynced entries.

 On app start or network regain:

Push new data → FastAPI

Mark entries as synced

Fetch updated analytics

 Add sync indicator (tiny icon or toast: “Syncing…”).

 Backend: /sync endpoints for efficient batch updates.

Success Criteria:
Users can log data fully offline, and everything auto-syncs when online.

2️⃣ Quick Logging Experience (1-Tap Logging)

Objective:
Allow users to log anything in under 5 seconds.

Tasks:

 Add floating “+” button with options → Meal / Workout / Body Stat

 Implement quick actions:

 “Repeat yesterday’s meal/workout”

 “Add favorite meal/workout”

 Autofill most recent inputs for each type.

 Use haptic feedback for completion.

Success Criteria:
Logging a meal/workout takes 3–5 seconds max.

3️⃣ Dashboard Screen (Daily Overview)

Objective:
Give users instant visibility of progress.

Tasks:

 Create Dashboard UI with cards for:

Calories vs target (progress ring)

Macro breakdown (protein/carb/fat)

Hydration progress

Weight trend (mini chart)

 Fetch summarized data from FastAPI /analytics/daily endpoint.

 Display consistency streak and last sync time.

Success Criteria:
Dashboard shows daily progress and syncs seamlessly after any update.

4️⃣ Notifications & Reminders

Objective:
Help users stay consistent without being intrusive.

Tasks:

 Integrate Expo Notifications (local for now).

 Add reminders for:

Meal logging (lunch/dinner)

Water reminders (based on hydration goal)

Weekly progress summary

 Allow users to toggle notification types in settings.

Success Criteria:
Smart reminders nudge users at relevant times, not spam them.

5️⃣ Analytics & Weekly Summaries

Objective:
Provide actionable progress summaries for motivation.

Tasks:

 Backend:

/analytics/weekly → calories/macros/workout frequency

/analytics/progress → weight, measurements trend

 Frontend:

Weekly trend cards (avg calories, protein, etc.)

7-day mini charts

 Add message banners: “You hit 80% of your protein goal this week!”

Success Criteria:
Users can see tangible progress and consistency metrics.

6️⃣ Personalization & Polishing

Objective:
Make the experience feel “alive” without AI (yet).

Tasks:

 Personalized greeting (“Good morning, Aasish”)

 Daily streak tracker & micro-badges

 Adaptive dashboard messages based on progress

 Smooth transitions + animations for premium feel

Success Criteria:
Users feel connected — not like they’re using a sterile data tracker.

7️⃣ (Optional Later) AI Layer Prep

(Don’t build now — just make the system ready for future integration)

Prepare for:

AI-based daily insights: “Your recovery looks great, maybe up intensity today.”

Nutrition recommendations based on trends.

Make sure API structure supports:

Historical query endpoints

User metrics context

Implementation Order (Recommended)
Order	Feature	Dev Effort	Impact	Notes
1	Offline + Sync	🔥 High	🚀 Very High	Core reliability
2	Quick Logging	⚙️ Medium	💨 High	Immediate UX boost
3	Dashboard	⚙️ Medium	📊 High	Motivation driver
4	Notifications	⚙️ Medium	🔔 Medium	Retention boost
5	Analytics	⚙️ Medium	📈 Medium	Progress insights
6	Personalization	🎨 Low	❤️ High	User engagement
🧱 Tech Setup Notes

Frontend:

React Native + SQLite (via react-native-sqlite-storage or expo-sqlite)

State: Context API (already in use) or consider Zustand for sync queue

Axios interceptors for retry logic on failed sync

Backend (FastAPI):

Routes for /sync, /analytics/daily, /analytics/weekly

Use background tasks for analytics aggregation

Ensure conflict resolution via last_updated timestamps

✅ End State of Phase 2

By the end of this phase:

Offline-first logging and syncing works flawlessly

Logging is effortless and near-instant

Dashboard + analytics provide instant feedback

Users feel motivated without AI

Backend ready for future personalization or AI layers
